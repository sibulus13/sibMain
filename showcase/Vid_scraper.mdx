  Digital media is a core part of my every day life, and I intended for it to remain that way while journeying on my summer road trip through two provinces (BC > AB).
  As my foresight is 2020, I began to research ways to provide offline digital media consumption due to my rationing of purchased data. 
  While Youtube Premium and some other subscription services attracted my attention, their monthly payments turned me away.
  From older torrenting days, I knew of the existence of free online resources that can help download certain media, and upon further research I discovered [Pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/): A Pythonic library for downloading YouTube videos. 
  Having some Python knowledge, I quickly implemented a prototype that can download a public Youtube video using the link provided. But why stop there? 
  There is no limitation to convenience, as I quickly found a [website](http://www.williamsportwebdeveloper.com/FavBackUp.aspx) that can provide the links of every video in a playlist, thanks @Williamsport Web Developer!
  All thats left is to throw together a little quick and dirty Python magic and voila: a video playlist downloader is born!
  Check out the script for yourself @ [Py Vid Scraper](https://github.com/sibulus13/Scraper/blob/master/vidScraper/vidScraper.py)!
