    ## Greetings after a weekend getaway in Tofino with papa Huang
    I have never felt as *moist* as I have in the past two days as I could swear
    it didn't stop raining for two hours consecutively for the entirety of our
    stay. It was quite unforunate that we did not get to enjoy the full glory of
    the many beaches offered, but the experience was still very much worth the
    6hr journey from Surrey > Nanaimo > Tofino.
