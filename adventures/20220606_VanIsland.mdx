`Bro it actully rains more in Vancouver (Unless you're in tofino)` - LiamW

    ## Greetings after a weekend getaway in Tofino with papa Huang 
    I have never felt as *moist* as I have in the past two days as I could swear it didn't
    stop raining for two hours consecutively throughout the duration of our
    stay. It was quite unforunate that we did not get to enjoy the full glory of
    the many beaches offered, but the experience was still very much worth the
    6hr journey from Surrey > Nanaimo > Tofino.
