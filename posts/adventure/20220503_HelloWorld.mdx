`A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step` - Laozi

    After years of procastinating on learning web development with more *convenient*
  site making methods such as
  [Wix](https://chengjiemichaelhua.wixsite.com/sibulus/), I have finally pulled
  the trigger on creating my own static website with
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ "title") and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/ "title").

    Will this be a blog page dedicated to technical know-hows on my personal
  struggle with software development? Or perhaps used to showcase my traveling
  adventures? Stay tuned to find out, because I haven't decided that for myself
  yet. In the meantime, here is a stock image of one of my favorite meme
  templates!
