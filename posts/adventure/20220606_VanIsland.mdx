`Bro it actully rains more in Vancouver (Unless you're in tofino)` - LiamW

    # Greetings after a weekend getaway in Tofino with papa Huang 
    I have never felt as *moist* as I have in the past two days as I could swear it only
    stop raining for two hours throughout the duration of our
    stay. It was quite unforunate that we did not get to enjoy the full glory of
    the many beaches offered, but the experience was still very much worth the
    6hr journey from Surrey > Nanaimo > Tofino.
    \
    \
    Getting off the ferry in Nanaimo, we took a stroll around Pipers Lagoon Park with multiple stop for photo ops before heading towards Tofino. 
    We stopped by the Smokin' George's BBQ restaurant to check out their speciality nanaimo bars as part of the Nanaimo trail, before checking out the Old Country Market where we were greeted by goats chilling on the roof top.
    After a final stop at Coombs Country Candy to stock up on munchies, we arrived at Tofino for the night.

    As we parked at our reserved camping spot, I quickly realized that my tent bag did not in fact carry the 3-man tent I assumed was inside, 
    and therefore I made the decision to sleep in the front passenger seat while Papa Huang took the makeshift bed in the back.
    The next morning was spent exploring the small town of Tofino, where we checked out many galleries and First Nations craft stores before snacking on some local fish and chips, yum!
    In the afternoon I took up surfing lessons and swallowed many mouthfuls of salt water while banging my head on the beach bottom, but hey at least I made an SFU acquaintance and caught a few small waves.
    After cleaning up, we made a quick trip to Ucluelet and visited the Amphitrite Point light house before retiring back to our camp site for the night.

    The final day of our shared trip is here, and we headed out bright and early in the morning for our drive back towards Victoria where I was to drop off Papa Huang.
    We went on a small hike to see the Hole in the Wall near Port Alberni before having lunch and snacks and then taking one last stroll throught the Kinsol Trestle, 
    where we saw the historical wooden rail bridges before heading back to the Victoria ferry terminal and said our goodbyes.

    # Let the solo car trip begin! To Victoria, and islands beyond
    Freedom at last! I arrived in Victoria and had dinner with Raymond before spending the night catching up.
    Early in the morning, I began my exploration of Victoria at Glencoe Cove as per Raymond's recommendation.
    I then visited the University of Victoria where I took a break from traveling and reminisce the student life by working on my blog website.
    I checked out the Fishermans Wharf for lunch and got myself some delicious oysters and fish & chips from a pier shop, before grabbing coffee from a nearby local coffee shop.
    To alleviate myself from my food coma, I went for a stroll around the government house before departing for my ferry ride to Galiano island, one of the souther gulf islands near Victroia.
    I severely overestimated the size of Galiano island as I completed a quick hike and drove the length of the island all within a few hours.  
    It was here that I was able to catch sight of the many beautiful ocean front properties, beaches, the fascinating sandstone caves, as well as have the pleasure of acquaintaing myself with this older gentleman whom I had the pleasure of discussing a variety of interesting topics throughout the night with, and advised me to know when to take it slow in life without rushing through the importance of the present.
    Looking back now, I can honestly say that I wish I allocated more time on this journey to some of these locations, where I found serenity and peace in the environemnt and lovely company to spend my time with.
    And it is also here, after half a day spent on this lovely secluded island, that I ferried back towards Victoria.

    # The Pacific Marine Circle Route
    Upon arrival back in Victoria, I immediately departed on one of the most beautiful ocean front drives I have experienced. 
    I made a few detours to check out Whiffin Spit at Sooke, Sheringham Point Lighthouse, as well as spend much of the afternoon at the Botanic Beach in Juan De Fuca Provincial Park.
    While the weather and time of day wasn't optimal for my visit throughout this portion of the journey, I was still able to witness the amazingness of nature in our provincial backyard, and be inspired to one day take on the Juan De Fuca trail to spend more time exploring the beauty offered here.
    Before you know it, I was heading back towards Nanaimo to decide on the last leg of my Vancouver Island journey.

    # Southern island explored... What now?
    I woke up in the morning by checking out the Abyss... which was a lot more anticlimatic than I imagined it to be after scrambling along the cliff side being off trail for most of my ascend.
    Arriving back in Nanaimo, I visited the White Rabbit Coffee Co. to work on my website a little more while deciding ultimately to visit Gabriola Island before heading back to Vancouver due to the uncertainty in how well my little old Corolla would tackle the conditions of the Northern island.   
    I quickly departed for Gabriola Island, the island of artists, where I traveled across the island to visit many of the scenic beach fronts that inspired many of the local artists there, such as the awe-inspiring Malaspina Galleries.
    Although I arrived on a Wednesday, a rest day for the local artists, I was granted a tour by an artist of her workshop and gallery and was amazed by the variety available in art.
    My last planned visit on the island would be the premium ciders farm but unfortunately they were closed for business that day. And so I ferried back to Victoria, and then back to home to rest up and recuperate before the next leg of my journey.
