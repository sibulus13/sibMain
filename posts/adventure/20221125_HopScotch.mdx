    Attended [Hopscotch Vancouver](https://www.hopscotchfestival.com/) with Jess this past Friday,
    and got to try out a diversity of liquor at the PNE.
    I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I definitely under estimated how many vendors would be on site
    with the availbility of 400+ product sampling. Jess and I both traded for 25 tokens and began our night's dive into alcoholism.

    We started off our night with a sample of Nikka whiskeys; I got the coffee grain while Jess got the Coffee malt.
    Although I have been trying to get into sipping whiskey as a consumerist hobby, I still can't handle the unique aftertaste of whiskey.
    The coffee grain whiskey made from corn was smooth, sweet but still have that distinct whiskey taste.
    While the coffee malt tasted just as sharp as the whiskey I have at home.
    I then visited the Patron stall to try the AÃ‘EJO which was aged over 12 months,
    and to my unrefined palette it just tasted like an extra smooth tequila.
    I would not mind sipping on this at home over ice after a long day of work.

    We then tried Sheringham gin, and the Rhubarb version I got tasted like a slightly sweet gin, while Jess's Lemon gin
    basically tasted like lemon juice.
    Jess then went to Bicardi to try their cocktail mixes, which were pleasantly mixed and is something I would love to have at partys.
    We finished off the night at Cambridge gin, where we sampled their truffle gin.
    While it smelled heavily of gin and induced my appetite, the taste was undeniably strong of gin with a slight truffle after taste.
    I wonder if I could keep a shot of this in my room as a liquid candle?

    We got to catch up with Kevin who was also there, and ended off the night with some homemade Pho from Ms.Chef herself
    while we re-watched Kung Fu Hustle over dinner. Overall it was a pleasant night, and I am happy for this opportunity to explore the different alcohols available.
