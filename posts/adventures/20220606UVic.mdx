`Bro it actully rains more in Vancouver (Unless you're in tofino)` - LiamW

<div>
  Greetings after a weekend getaway in Tofino with papa Huang, 
  I have never felt as wet as I have been in the past two days as I could swear it didn't stop 
  raining for two hours consecutively for the entirety of our stay. It was quite unforunate that
  we did not get to enjoy the full glory of the many beaches offered, but the experience was still very 
  much worth the 6hr journey from Surrey > Nanaimo > Tofino.
